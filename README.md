# Instructions
We have included a [dataset](dataset.psv) and task to provide a foundation for further discussion. This data was pulled from an online spam/ham corpus; the task is to create a process towards the best spam/ham classifier you can in around 2 hours. The goal isnâ€™t to perfect every step but rather for you to show your thought processes; so spend your time accordingly with the evaluation criteria below in mind.

* Use Python in a Jupyter Notebook for all work
* Include any references for code that influenced your answer
  * Use markdown & comments to help us understand your thought process
* Show us the code, outputs, and process for creating classifier
  * Try to time-box this exercise to around 2 hours
  * Be clear in your code and comments
  * Going too in-depth will not win you bonus points
* In the last paragraph
  * How do you think this model would do in the wild? and why?
  * Explain where you would take the model building process if it had to be released into production

# How will you be evaluated
* Quality of code
* Clarity in reasoning
* Validity and performance of the model

# What are the deliverables
* HTML output of your Jupyter notebook showing all of your work
